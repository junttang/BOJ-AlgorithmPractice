# BOJ-Algorithm-Practice
The source codes of mine for practicing a Problem Solving (Algorithm). All problems are from the BOJ sites.

This repository contains the source codes written by myself for solving algorithm problems in BOJ sites.
Since I'm taking the algorithm course given by Baekjoon Choi in the CODE PLUS site during this summer vacation(2021), most of these codes are related to the basic algorithm and data structures needed for preparing lots of interviews(coding test) I'll take in the future. Thus, I'm gonna record my algorithm studying process for recap/reviewing, by uploading all source codes to this repository. Mostly I'll use C++ for solving problems but there can be codes written in another language sometimes.
