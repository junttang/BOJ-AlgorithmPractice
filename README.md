# BOJ-Algorithm-Practice
The source codes of mine for practicing a Problem Solving (Algorithm). Most of problems are from the BOJ sites.

This repository contains **the source codes written by myself for solving algorithm problems in BOJ & AOJ sites.**
Since I took the algorithm course given by Baekjoon Choi in the **CODE PLUS site** during the summer vacation of 2021, most of these codes are related to the basic algorithm and data structures needed **for preparing lots of interviews(coding test) I'll take in the future.** 

Thus, **I'm gonna record my algorithm studying process for the sake of recap/reviewing**, by uploading all source codes to this repository. 
Mostly I'll use **C++** for solving problems but there can be codes written in another language sometimes.
